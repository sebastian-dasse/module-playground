# What is this project all about?

I just wanted to get a first understanding of how the **Java Module System** and the Java **ServiceLoader** work and how they play together in a gradle project. Also I wanted to try out Java's **Dynamic Proxy** in practice, which I did in the alternative service implementation with added logging.
